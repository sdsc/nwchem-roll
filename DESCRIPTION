NWCHEM (Northwest Chem)

This roll source supports building with different compilers and for different
network fabrics.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers for ethernet.
To build for a different configuration, use the ROLLCOMPILER and ROLLNETWORK
make variables, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx

The build process currently supports the values "intel" and "gnu" for the
ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It uses any ROLLNETWORK variable
value to load the appropriate openmpi module, assuming that there is a module
named openmpi_$(ROLLCOMPILER) available (e.g., openmpi_ib, openmpi_mx, etc.).

If the ROLLCOMPILER and/or ROLLNETWORK variables are specified, their values
are incorporated into the names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=ib

produces a roll with a name that begins "nwchem-intel-ib"; it contains and
installs a similarly-named rpm.
